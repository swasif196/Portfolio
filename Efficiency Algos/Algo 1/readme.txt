make all or make <- compiles the program with data_1.txt & data_2.txt as sample data and all
                    files need to be in the directory.
compiled file is called main. If you wish to compile with a different data set.
You can either modify main.c or use another main to compile.

When main is run it runs 1.1 and then waits for you to press a key before running 1.2 and then does the same for 2.1 and 2.2. After running 2.2 it exits the program.

This project implements the inversion algorithm and convex-hull algorithm using multiple techniques and comparing each technique for time efficiency. The comparison is given in design.txt
